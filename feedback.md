# Feedback on Project Work
## Brean Prefontaine

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Brean, I really like the way you have structured this summary, especially with the "Ways I think I will use this article" section. That's very helpful to me to give you feedback. I think you've done a great job sumamrizing these articles. The Boyle and Smith article while old does seem very important for your paper as you explain how CCDs work. I'm glad that you read that one. Going forward, I'd like you to dig a bit deeper into the mathematical models and/or experiments that are being done around CCDs or single electron CCDs. The next articles that you dig into should build on what you have learned from these, but also focus your efforts to some aspect(s) that you want to present in your final paper. Excellent work so far!

## Assignment 1

Brean, single electron CCDs are going to be incredibly important across physics very soon - this topic is quite timely and important. I'm glad to see you relating this to your prior work in physics as well. The papers that you proposed are quite possibly dense. I think the PRL is an interesting article, but quite possibly dense on first glance. My suggestion would be to read some sort of review article about CCDs in addition to these to make sure that you can present the nature of CCDs and how single electron CCDs work. A couple of papers that might be helpful are linked below:
http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.17578
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01790.x/full
http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1488674
I think focusing on CCDS in general and then talking about the E&M behind the single electron CCDs would make for an excellent paper. Great work so far!
