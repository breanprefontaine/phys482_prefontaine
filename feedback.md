# Feedback on Project Work
## Brean Prefontaine

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 6

Brean, you have a nearly complete paper here. I think you know what you need to add from your meta statements to yourself. The overall writing and structure of the paper are in good shape, and I have little concern that you about you being able to edit the new addition to this same quality. It's all very well written. I think if I have one thing that I want you to consider is the challenges associated with the Sipper CCD. You say a lot about the future uses, but I'm wondering about the technological challenges of making such a tool more commericalized. You know the standard CCD is now in every digitial camera device and scaled down to the a few millimeters. How are we going to get there with the Skipper CCD? This might involve reading a more popular account. Here's a few possible examples:

Great work on this paper!

## Assignment 4

Brean, you've got a great scaffold here for a full paper. Also the meta statements to yourself and me are helfpul. I tihnk it's pretty clear that you know what to work on. A few ideas that might help to make some of transitions that you have: consider the differences between the boring CCD and the Skipper CCD as a way of moving between them (you might also consider how they serve different purposes). The Skipper CCD section appears a bit more technical and that might be because you are still forming an idea of how all the aspects that you have read about play together into a narrative. The way you have presented the boring CCD could help frame the Skipper CCD portion (i.e., so that they have some parallel presentation). So I think you are close to a complete draft, but you have some feedback for yourself and my feedback here might also provide some scaffolding for dealing with your own feedback. Great work!

## Assignment 3

Brean, again, I really appreciate how you are writing your summaries. It appears that you have decided to focus on the Skipper CCD and how it works, which is a reasonable thing to focus on. I will like to see you dig into the design and the mathematical models necessary to understand it. In so doing, you will need to draw on the Boyle and Smith article to explain CCDs in general. You assignment this week is to synthesize across the articles that you have read and start to develop a coherent narrative of your background research. In that synthesis, it would be fine to start pulling together all the details and contrasting the old CCD technology with the Skipper CCD if that makes sense for the narrative that you are going for. Great work.

## Assignment 2

Brean, I really like the way you have structured this summary, especially with the "Ways I think I will use this article" section. That's very helpful to me to give you feedback. I think you've done a great job sumamrizing these articles. The Boyle and Smith article while old does seem very important for your paper as you explain how CCDs work. I'm glad that you read that one. Going forward, I'd like you to dig a bit deeper into the mathematical models and/or experiments that are being done around CCDs or single electron CCDs. The next articles that you dig into should build on what you have learned from these, but also focus your efforts to some aspect(s) that you want to present in your final paper. Excellent work so far!

## Assignment 1

Brean, single electron CCDs are going to be incredibly important across physics very soon - this topic is quite timely and important. I'm glad to see you relating this to your prior work in physics as well. The papers that you proposed are quite possibly dense. I think the PRL is an interesting article, but quite possibly dense on first glance. My suggestion would be to read some sort of review article about CCDs in addition to these to make sure that you can present the nature of CCDs and how single electron CCDs work. A couple of papers that might be helpful are linked below:
http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.17578
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01790.x/full
http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1488674
I think focusing on CCDS in general and then talking about the E&M behind the single electron CCDs would make for an excellent paper. Great work so far!
