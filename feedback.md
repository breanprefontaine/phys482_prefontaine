## Assignment 1

Brean, single electron CCDs are going to be incredibly important across physics very soon - this topic is quite timely and important. I'm glad to see you relating this to your prior work in physics as well. THe papers that you proposed are quite possibly dense. I think the PRL is an interesting article, but quite possibly dense on first glance. My suggestion would be to read some sort of review article about CCDs in addition to these to make sure that you can present the nature of CCDs and how single electron CCDs work. A couple of papers that might be helpful are linked below:
http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.17578
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1970.tb01790.x/full
http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1488674
I think focusing on CCDS in general and then talking about the E&M behind the single electron CCDs would make for an excellent paper. Great work so far!

* Score: 20/20
